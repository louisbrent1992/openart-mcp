# OpenArt Skill

Pair to the `openart-mcp` server (https://github.com/jbertus/openart-mcp). OpenArt.ai has no public API, so the MCP drives the web UI via Playwright. This skill tells Claude when and how to call the MCP tools.

## Tools available (from openart-mcp)

- `openart_list_characters` — return every character in the user's account
- `openart_get_character` — fetch one character by **name** (this OpenArt UI has no numeric IDs)
- `openart_create_character` — create a new character from a local front-facing image
- `openart_generate_video` — generate a video from a **text prompt** (OpenArt's Text-to-Video). Good for **product ads**: describe the scene in `script` and optionally attach a product photo (`image_path`) or a character (`character_id`).
- `openart_get_video_status` — poll a video render by the id returned from `generate_video`

## Intent → tool routing

| User intent | Tool sequence |
|---|---|
| "What characters do I have on OpenArt?" / "list avatars" | `openart_list_characters` |
| "Show me [character name]" | `openart_list_characters` → `openart_get_character` |
| "Create a new OpenArt character" / "make an avatar from this image" | `openart_create_character` |
| "Make a product ad video" / "video of this product" | `openart_generate_video` { script, image_path } |
| "Make a video featuring [character]" | `openart_list_characters` (confirm name) → `openart_generate_video` { script, character_id } |
| "Is the video done?" / "check video status" | `openart_get_video_status` |

## Argument tips

- **Characters are identified by NAME**, not a numeric id. Pass the character's display name everywhere a character id is expected.
- **`image_path`** must be an **absolute local path** (Playwright reads from disk). For `generate_video`, this is the reference image — e.g. a **product photo** to feature in the ad.
- **`script`** (generate_video) is the **video prompt**: describe the scene, action, mood, and what the product/character does. It is NOT spoken dialogue — this UI generates a clip from the description; it does not lip-sync speech.
- **`aspect_ratio`** options: `9:16` (vertical/Reels/Shorts/TikTok), `16:9` (landscape/YouTube), `1:1` (square), plus `4:3`, `3:4`, `21:9`. Best-effort; defaults to the tool's current setting if it can't be set.
- **`character_id`** (generate_video) is optional — attach an existing character so it appears in the shot. If both `image_path` and `character_id` are given, `image_path` wins.
- **`background_story`** when creating a character: persona, mannerisms, wardrobe. OpenArt uses it for consistency across generations.
- **Voice when creating a character** is an audio upload / library picker in the UI — the `voice_id` argument is currently ignored.

## Latency expectations

- `list_characters` / `get_character`: 5–15s (browser launch + page load)
- `create_character`: 30–90s (upload + processing)
- `generate_video`: returns a job id immediately; render takes ~1–10 minutes; poll `get_video_status`. Costs ~400 credits/run.

## Common patterns

### Product ad video
```
1. openart_generate_video { script: "<ad concept: scene, action, mood>", image_path: "/abs/path/product.png", aspect_ratio: "9:16" }
2. openart_get_video_status { video_id } — poll every 30s until status == "complete"
3. Return the resulting video URL to the user
```

### Video featuring an existing character
```
1. openart_list_characters → confirm the character's name
2. openart_generate_video { script, character_id: "<name>", aspect_ratio }
3. openart_get_video_status { video_id } — poll until complete
```

### New character from a fresh image
```
1. openart_create_character { name, image_path, background_story? }
2. Reuse the character by NAME in later calls
```

## Setup verification

If a tool call fails with "No saved auth at...":
```
cd <path-to-openart-mcp>
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
npm run login
```

If a tool returns empty / wrong data, OpenArt has likely redesigned and the selectors in `src/tools.ts` are stale. Re-capture against the live UI:
```
npx playwright codegen https://openart.ai/suite/characters-and-worlds
npx playwright codegen https://openart.ai/suite/create-video
```
and update the matching selectors in `src/tools.ts`, then `npm run build`.

## Limits and risks

- **No public API** — every action drives the web UI as a logged-in user
- **UI changes break selectors** — periodic re-tuning required
- **Anti-bot detection** — heavy automation may rate-limit or ban the account
- **Session expiration** — re-run `npm run login` when prompted
- **One browser instance at a time** — concurrent tool calls share the session
